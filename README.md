# HousePricePrediction

This is a a House price prediction system using Machine Learning with Python.I  as a student have always 
wanted to learn to make projects which can solve some real life problems. And with same intent I started 
looking for languagaes and tools used for dong so and here I am. 

It all started with my curiosity to learn about Artificial Intelligence and the ability of AI to solve 
several Real Life Problems. So I tried learning in detail about Supervised and unsupervised learning. 

Here is my first project on supervised learning which uses regression for predicting house prices.
